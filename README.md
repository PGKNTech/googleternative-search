# Googleternative Search Poral BY PGKNT
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PGKNTech/googleternative-search/main/googalterlogo.png" alt="">
<p>private search portal. It uses different search engines to provide users a feeling of confidence without getting tracked by google.</p>

#Search Portal
<p>Googleternative is a search portal which only <b>DIRECTS<b> your queries in our search box to 3 most picked private search engine, 
Duckduckgo, Startpage, and Mojeek. A custom search engine will be available as a different repository coming soon.</p>
  
#APP
<p>Unfortunately, Googleternative search portal is not a downloadable application. It is only a web software and a prototype project for
a search engine which will be using searx as search engine hosting provider for our search engine.</p>

#About
<p>Googleternative is the first idea and repo made by pgknt, but after some design changes, the original was deleted from github and then relaunched
  with a newer design. A redesign of Googleternative was suggested in a meeting of a school club in APEC Schools (Philippines): WDP/Web Design and Programming
  club.</p>
  
  #Future
  <p>Googleternative will have its own search engine site called PALE (Privacy-friendly and Lookup Engine). A privacy respecting search site which will have our own searx intsance. once we have hosted our instance we will immediately develop PALE. you may search it as <a href="https://pgkntech.github.io/PALE/dev-test">https://pgkntech.github.io/PALE/dev-test</a> for the first 3 weeks after created while still a test prototype, and then it will be searched as <a href="https://pgkntech.github.io/PALE/">https://pgkntech.github.io/PALE</a> After 1 month its launched.
