<h1><b>Googleternative Search Poral BY PGKNT</b></h1>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PGKNTech/googleternative-search/main/googalterlogo.png" alt="">
<p>private search portal. It uses different search engines to provide users a feeling of confidence without getting tracked by google.</p>

<h1><b>Search Portal</b></h1>
<p>Googleternative is a search portal which only <b>DIRECTS</b> your queries in our search box to 4 most used private search engines, 
<b>Duckduckgo, Startpage, and Mojeek, and now, brave search.</b></p>
  
<h1><b>APP</b></h1>
<p>Unfortunately, <b>Googleternative search portal</b> is not a downloadable application. It is only a web software and a prototype project for a highschool task. 
Soon, Googleternative may be transfered into a usable application with a few tweaks. </p>

<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<p>Googleternative is the first idea and repo made by PGKNT, but after some design changes, the original was deleted from github and then relaunched
  with a newer design. A redesign of Googleternative was suggested in a meeting of a school club in APEC Schools (Philippines): WDP/Web Design and Programming
  club.</p>
  
 <h1><b>Future</b></h1>
  <p>Expect an added search engine that uses the API of brave search, if so happens that they shared it. This will support the index of Googleternative own search engine.</p>
